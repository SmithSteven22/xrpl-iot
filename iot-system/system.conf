# Configuration for an IoTempower system
# Everything from iot/etc/iotempower.conf can be overwritten here.
# However, you will usually just overwrite the MQTT-Host and maybe
# wifi access information

# Name of accesspoint to connect to
ULNOIOT_AP_NAME="iot-test"

# Its wifi password
ULNOIOT_AP_PASSWORD="St123456"

# Connect data for local MQTT broker
# If not defined, the same as ULNOIOT_AP_IP from iotempower.conf default
ULNOIOT_MQTT_HOST="192.168.1.68"
